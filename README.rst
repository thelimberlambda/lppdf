   lppdf is a Python-based utility designed to "line print" text files to PDF
   format, in particular, files in old "eyeline" format (that is, 132 column and 60
   lines, with embedded carriage-return (\x0d), line-feed (\x0a) and form-feed
   (\x0c) ASCII control characters).

Installation
------------

1. Ensure that Python 2.7.10+ is installed (lppdf hasn't been tested with
   Python 3);
2. Ensure that ReportLab (http://www.reportlab.com/) is installed (see 
   README_RL.rst for detailed instructions for installing RL using `pip`);
3. Ensure that Ghostscript is installed;
4. Ensure that the path to `gs`/`gswin32c` (Ghostscript command-line tool)
   is set up properly;
5. Ensure that Imagemagick is installed;
6. Confirm that paths to Imagemagick tools are correctly set up by openging a
   console/command prompt and issuing the `identify` and `compare` commands.

Invocation
----------

  python lpppdf.py <options> <text-file>

Help
----

  python lppdf.py --help

Tests
-----

In the bundle is a Python-based test script and a number of test case files
(under `./tests`).  PDF's are generated based on a given set of arguments, and a
"correct" sample compared-against in order to return a pass/fail condition.

In order to ensure that tests run correctly, the following programs need to be
installed:

* Ghostscript (lppdf uses `gs`/`gswin32`);
* Imagemagick (lppdf uses the `identify` and `compare` programs)

To run all tests:

  ./make test

or...

  make test

for Windows.

Gitlog
------

A git log is contained in `./gitlog` and is a useful means of gaining insight
into changes rolled into this version.
